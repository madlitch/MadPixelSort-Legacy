# MadPixelSort Legacy

MadPixelSort is a standalone program created to produce glitch effects 
in images by pixel sorting. 

### NOTE: This project is no longer being maintained, as I am creating a commercial version. Link to the new MPS will be here upon release.

## Installation

 You will need Java 8 or above installed on your machine (https://www.java.com/en/download/).

Either download the respective executable for your operating system (under releases: https://github.com/madlitch/MadPixelSort/releases), or download Processing (https://processing.org/) and run the .pde in Processing.

When on Windows, do not move the executable file (MadPixelSort.exe) out of the containing folder. Otherwise, the application will not work.

## Usage
#### Sorting
Load the file you wish to pixel sort, it must be either a .jpeg or a .png.
Click the corresponding radio button of the mode you want to use. 
You can adjust the threshold sliders of each color sorting mode. 
The higher the threshold, the less pixels will
be included in the sorting run.

#### Saving
The first time you click save, you will be prompted to choose the folder you wish to export the files to. After choosing the host folder, click the save button again. You can save your exports as either .tiff, .jpeg, or .png files.

The program will create a folder named *filename*_*sorted*, and will save all your exports there.

The exported file will have a filename with this structure: 

*filename* _*direction* _*mode* *value*.*extension*

For example, for an image with the name DSC31, sorted vertically by brightness
with a threshold of 87, saved as a .tiff, the output will look like this:

DSC31_V_BRI87.tiff

The program does not keep track of stacked sorting, however whatever you see
in the preview window is what will be exported. The last options used
will be the ones shown in the file name.
